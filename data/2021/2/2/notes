Continuing the dash to get rid of all remaining non-vegan things in the house...
Ate all of the remaining sausages and three of the yorkshire puddings in one sitting.
That was ... quite a lot. But it was delicious. No wait that doesn't make it any better, uhhhmmmmmm...

Well anyway, there's a little bit less to get through now, what still remains is:
 - yorkshire puddings (now only four left)
 - honey
 - red thai curry paste (contains fish sauce)
 - cheese biscuits
 - Bisto chicken gravy granules
 - milk chocolate

Yorkshire puddings and gravy is good, could easilly finish off the yorkshires with a cheeky midnight snack.
There's a significant amount of gravy left though. I'm gonna need to find some more excuses to eat that.

I'll make a plan for the curry paste, I don't often use honey, not sure what to do with that.
I bought it to make honey mustard pigs in blankets for christmas day. mmMMMmmmm they were ooOOhhh so delicious, but they're ... like ... triple not-vegan.
Strike one: sausage, strike two: bacon, strike three: honey. Oh wait, strike four also, because I put some Bisto gravy on them.

Anyway I don't plan to make them again, so I need to do something else with the honey.
