beginning the clean up of all the non vegan things I have still in the house
The list:
 - gammon
 - sausages
 - yorkshire puddings
 - honey
 - red thai curry paste (contains fish sauce)
 - cheese biscuits
 - Bisto chicken gravy granules
 - milk chocolate

Today I at the gammon. Oh my goodness it's so tasty. I have missed this. I know you don't wanna hear but it's the truth. :'(
