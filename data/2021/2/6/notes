Mmmm, had some Chicken style nuggets that were actually good this time, unlike the "this" chicken.
Anyway, now I'm down to this list of things to get rid of:
 - yorkshire puddings x3
 - honey
 - red thai curry paste (contains fish sauce)
 - Bisto chicken gravy granules
I didn't mean fot this to be a vegan day, I needed to use up things, so I should have used up something, but I ran out of time to cook so I couldn't really.
