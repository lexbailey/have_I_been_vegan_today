Honestly this is the slowest I've ever eaten chocolate, why is it not all gone yet?
I even had to throw some out because I stupidly left one bar by a radiator. How do I still have some left?

Cracked open the cheese biscuits too. Urgh trying to eat a whole bunch of non vegan things quickly just to get to """the good stuff""" slightly sooner is probably not the best idea.
Anyway, I'm nearly there.

Still not sure what to do with the honey, can I just drink it? Is that an option? Do people do that?
