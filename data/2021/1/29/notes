I had vegan cake! It's good!
There's a strong raspberry flavour, presumably to hide that fact that the vegan chocolate doesn't taste great? (see other vegan "milk" chocolates I tried)
But overall it's a cake I am happy to eat :)
I have had better cakes (that are made with lots of egg and milk). But I reckon I wouldn't mind having this cake in place of any them.
