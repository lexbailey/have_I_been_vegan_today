Never bothered much to make my own salads at home. Decided this would be the time to try though.
Had a vegan salad for breakfast. Or was it lunch? ... who knows?
I ate the last of the cookies. So again failed to be vegan today, but at least the cookies are now gone.
There's still lots of chocolate in the house. I don't feel so bad eating it because it's already been purchased.
It's not like I'm deliberately buying non-vegan things at the moment.
Yes, I ate some chocolates, shame on me. They were lindor, they were delicious, I could eat them all day.
Maybe that's the solution? Spend a day eating the whole chocolate stash, get to do some fully vegan days sooner.
I tried "This is not chicken" today. Oh my! The flavour does not exist inside the "chicken" area at all. It is entirely concentrated on the outer skin, which has a breadcrumb appearance, but also looks a little ... strange. Can't explain it, but I preapred it exactly how they said to, and it tasted disgusting. I really wasn't expecting it to be that bad. I've had fake chicken nuggets before and couldn't tell them apart from real ones. These ones though ... what did they do to them? How did they make them that bad? I don't know, but I'm certainly not buying "This" again.
