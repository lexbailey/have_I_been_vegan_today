Okay, so I ate the rest of pasta sauce that I had cooked, another probably today. Won't cook any more of that for a while
Anyway...
Friday night, feels like a good excuse for a takeaway, so I got a vegan vindaloo on Deliveroo from a local indian restaurant.
It was spicy, good. Contained cauliflower though, ew, hate that stuff. Broccoli ghost bad :( broccoli living good :)
