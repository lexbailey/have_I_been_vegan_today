Started veganuary today, bought some vegan food.
Might have accidentally bought some pasta sauce that's not vegan. Does not claim to be vegan, but also doesn't list any non-vegan ingredients.
Ate some things from christmas stock of treats: milk chocolate cookies, lindor milk chocolate.
Will eventually wear down this stash, but for now the cookies and chocolate are making otherwise vegan days into not-vegan days.
Saturday, fast food normally a thing, decided to try McDonalds' spicy veggie wrap (which is vegan). It's not bad really, quite enjoyed it, but doesn't taste as good as chicken.
Might try the veggie dippers without the wrap next time, see what I think.
Made a slow-cooked sausage caserole with Richmond meat-free sausages and vegan mash. It was delicious.
Tried Alpro almond milk. It tastes fine until you swallow it. Then it tastes awful.
