That pasta sauce struck again, leftovers from the last batch I made, that makes today another probably. I'm gonna eat the last bit tomorrow, then I will have no more of it until the end of Jan.

It's half way through now and I've not really done that well. If we count the "probably" days then I have achieved a streak of 6 including today.
The counter at the top of this page does not count those days though, sadly. (I could change that but it would feel wrong.) So actually I've only done 3 days.
So that's not a particularly good record, and I think that's because I decided late to do this, I didn't prepare for it, I had so much leftover non-vegan stuff, and I was careless when buying pasta sauce.

Okay, so here's the plan...
I'm gonna get to the end of January eating as vegan as possible, then I'm gonna eat all of the non-vegan stuff that I have in one day (I _think_ that's possible, I don't have much left).
That day will be the 31st of January. By that point I will have been through most of January and will have a baseline to compare February against.
And so, clearly if I want to do things properly, I need to do a fully vegan month in February. What shall I call it? ... hmmm ... Vegebruary I suppose.
