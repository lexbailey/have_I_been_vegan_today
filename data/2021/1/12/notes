* sigh * another "probably" today because of the pasta sauce. I had some more of it. :'(

Tried a spicy vegan cheese today, it was spicy. :)
I'm not sure I'm really a fan of spicy cheese. I probably won't buy it again. Tasted fine, but the things that I want cheese on are not generally the things I want to be spicy.
