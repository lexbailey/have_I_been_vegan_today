Decided to try frying some vegan sausages for dinner today. I had some richmond fake sausages in a caserole earlier in january, but this time I'm just gonna fry them and have them with some vegetables.
A fairly simple meal.
Otherwise nothing too special today. Bought a couple of other vegan cheeses to try, we'll see how those go tomorrow I think.

Will report back on the vegan sausages later...

Update: it is now later :)
The vegan chipolatas tasted not like real chipolatas. This was entirely anticipated.
The taste is okay, but it's not something I think I really want to eat again. Compared to the taste of something like the vegetarian butcher magic mince that I had recently, it's not really on the same level at all. :'(
