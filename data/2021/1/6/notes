Lunch time gone, done fine so far.
Tried Montezuma's "Like no udder" milk chocolate alternative. Looks like dark chocolate, smells like dark chocolate, quacks like dark chocolate, but it tastes like ... diluted dark chocolate?
For the record, I don't like dark chocolate. Ewwww it's horrible, I don't know how people can like dark chocolate. This Like no Udder is okay, but I probably won't seek it out.
Milk chocolate is sooooo good. Would like to find an acceptable substitute.

Dinner time update: Had some fake mince. It was the Vegetarian Butcher's Magic Mince. Praise the gods of veganism for we have been blessed with the holy grail of fake meats.
Didn't get my hopes up for it really, after the experience I had with "This is Not Chicken" I wasn't expecting the strongest of comebacks from the world of fake meats so suddenly.
Truly magic mince must actually be magic. It cooks quicker. It cooks easier. It tastes better. Just that simple.

Also, the reason today is a "probably" is because I can't find a primary source of information to answer the question "Is Dolmio Original bolognese sause vegan?".
Their official website doesn't say it is vegan, only that it is vegetarian, which makes me suspect that it is not vegan.
Was my evening's Pasta Bolognese vegan? Who knows?
