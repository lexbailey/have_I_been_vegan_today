Gonna try and resist eating any of my chocolate statsh today, see if I can get at least one full-vegan day in early-on before I've run down the chocolate.
Breakfast was another salad, got a little bit scared when I couldn't see the "suitable for vegans" on the french dressing, but it is there, I did find it, phew.
Housemate still does not suspect. Or at least they haven't let me know that they suspect. They've certainly seen me with some very vegan foods.
I wonder how long it will be before they say notice or say something.
Normally I have up to 12 pints of milk in the fridge at once. (Yes, I drank quite a lot of milk) But with Alpro in its place, surely they're gonna start to wonder soon.

Update from 8pm: housemate now knows, we got deliveroo from a half-vegan place. I had vegan, they had pork, boooo!
Yes I decided not to cook, shame on me. Was nice food though, some kind of greek street food thing.

Update from 23:30: Just tried Soya milk for the first time. It's soooo much better than almond milk.
I don't know if I want to sample all the various nut milks, but I think soya would be a suitable alternative for me.
So far I have tried almond milk, both sugary and sugarless, and also sugary soya milk. No question the soya is the best, no bitter aftertaste for me.

Also I bought some vegan cheeses and vegan "milk" chocolate. Will try some of those at some point soon and report my thougts.
