I bought two vegan gravys yesterday from tesco. Decided I would try one today. I started with the "Gravy granules for beef".
I had to fulfill the vegan obligation to laugh at the fact that they suggest you put this stuff on beef sausages.
(I know, I know, but I wanna have some fun here :D ...)
For one: I'm vegan b*thces! XD
For two: Hmmmm, beef sausages. If you're gonna eat beef you want a steak. Well done, of course. Pork sausages are the best sausages.
 ... oh no, now the vegans are angry at me for liking beef steak and pork, and all the people that think "well done" steak is pure evil are also angry at me.
Anyway, I made bangers and mash. I had the gravy. The gravy was not particularly noticable. Which is either: good because I can't tell it apart from normal gravy, or bad because actually it's tasteless and I'm missing something by using this gravy.
The mash was good, the veg was veg (you can't really get veg wrong, it was good), but I really don't like these Heck sausages. I'm not gonna buy them again.
The richmond ones I had before were okay, but I slow cooked those in a really good sauce. Maybe I'll try having them "neat" and see if they're better than Heck's.
