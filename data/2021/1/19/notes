Am I getting deliveroo too frequently these days?
Well never mind, there's [conveniently] no time to answer that question becuase I need to tell you about "Vegan Vice".
They're in cambridge on deliveroo and they do these things called "Hot Chilli Strips" and they're like chicken strips but they're not chicken.
They're vegan, they're tasty, they're pleasingly spicy, they're crispy but not too crispy, they're "OH MY GOODNESS I WANT MORE OF THIS IN MY MOUTH" kind of good.
Never expected to be throwing such compliments around for vegan food.

If I was to revert to being a carnivore, I would no doubt still be eating some of the vegan things that I've tried this month. Various vegan cheeses for sure, these magical things from Vegan Vice also, and that magic mince stuff too.
Mmmmmmm, this evening's food was gooooood. :D
