Another "probably" day, because I had the leftovers from yesterday and I'm still not sure if that pasta sauce is vegan.
Another new experience today: "Creamy Original Flavour Violife". It is AMAZING! If this was the same price as dairy soft cheeses then I would be recommending this to all my non-vegan soft-cheese-eating friends, and not even as a joke. This is actually good stuff!
I have had some on my cream crackers, which are also vegan (of course, I'm doing veganuary, that's the whole point of this thing. Also I'm not sure how you would make crackers not-vegan, but I'm sure there's a way.)

Nothing else new today though. I do have another vegan cheese to try, but I stuffed myself with creamy-violife-covered crackers and so I'm not really in the mood for more cheese today.
