I ate lindor.

Hey! Don't be like that, I already had it in the house and I need to get through it all. I didn't buy any of it recently. I got it all for Christmas as gifts.

Other than that I've been a good person though. :)
Update: Tried another wrap from the place I got food from on Tuesday 5th. (I know, getting takeaway food from the same place twice in one week, oh my!)
This one had a fake frankfurter in it, it was good. I enjoyed it so much I had eaten it before remembering to take a photo for this log.
