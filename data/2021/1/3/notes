Day two in the big brother house.
No wait, not that.
Nothing much special today, still trying to learn to like Alpro almond milk.
I bought both the unsweetened and sugary versions for science.
The sugary one doesn't have that much sugar in, but tastes much better than the sugarless one.
Feels quite a bit like normal milk, certainly cool and refreshing, but that aftertaste is nasty.
Ate more vegan mash with the left-over sausage caserole from yesterday.
The mash was made with the sweet almond milk this time and tasted better than yesterday's mash.
Another almost-vegan day except for cookies and chocolate. Will finish with those soon.
