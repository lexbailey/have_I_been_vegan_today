Well here we are at the end of the month. I haven't done tooo bad, but I think it is now time to purge all my remaining non-vegan foods, and try again with february.
It might be a shaky start to feb as a result, but that's fine. I'll go as fast as I can XD.
I ate some of the milk chocolate already, I'm gonna defrost some of the meat I still have in the freezer now and eat it tomorrow.
I'm going all in! ... for one month. :) then we'll reevaluate

Oh also I had some more richmond sausages today, except not in a caserole. I also used some of the tesco vegan gravy. This time is was the vegetable one. Gravy was good, would recommend. Sausages without the caserole sauce: hmm, yeah not too bad.
